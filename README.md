# JPEG Compression

This is a project to understand the interworking behind the JPEG algorithm. 
Since a significant portion of the algorithm is deeply rooted in mathematical concepts,
I went ahead to implement this project in MATLAB. with that said it can be easy ported to 
python as wellðŸ˜‰.

## Installation


Download MATLAB from [here](https://matlab.mathworks.com/). U need to have a licensed accountðŸ˜Ÿ
,u could also use your organization/university emailðŸ™‚.

Install image processing toolbox from [here](https://in.mathworks.com/products/image.html).

## Running the code

- Clone the repo and navigate to the directory in matlab.
- Under current folder section right click and  select `add to path`> `current folder` option.
- your uncompressed images should be placed in `images/` folder.
- compressed image is saved as `result.jpg` in parent folder.
- `compression.m` is the main script for compression. Plenty of comments is provided so you won't be lostðŸ˜‰
### Before compiling
- specify the `filename`to path of your uncompressed image eg: `images/[your img].tiff`.
- Depending on whether the img is raw or rgb(jpg, png, tiff) img use `raw2rgb` or `imread` respectively.
